Description:
This auto typer is a great and simple auto typer to use! It is currently in ALPHA testing and will be open to new features, updates, and encancements. There may be bugs as this is relativly new.

This is a C++ native application with usage from the Windows.h library. This may not work on other platforms other than Windows.

How to Use:
When you download Orange Auto Typer, you should get a folder. Inside of that folder there should be 3 things, a folder named src, an application called Orange Auto Typer, and a file called commands.json. commands.json is the commands that will be used by the application. Open the commands.json file, and there will be an example of how to use it demonstrated with the "beg" object. For help on how to use json, enter an issue on this repository. Once you have entered the commands in json, open the Orange Auto Typer application and follow the steps required.
